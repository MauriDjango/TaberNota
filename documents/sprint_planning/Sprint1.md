# Sprint 1 - Foundation & Initial Setup

## Setup (Project & Infrastructure)
- [x] Set up **Vue.js frontend** with Vite.
- [x] Set up **Spring Boot backend** with essential dependencies.
- [x] Configure **database structure** (design schema for restaurants, tables, orders, users).
- [x] Set up **Firebase or AWS** (if needed for authentication/storage).
- [x] Research and configure **real-time updates** (consider WebSockets).
- [x] Define **project structure** to ensure scalability and modularity.

## Backend (Spring Boot & Database)
- [x] Implement a **basic authentication system** (user login/logout).
- [x] Implement **role-based access control** (manager, waiter, client, etc.).
- [x] Develop **database models** for restaurants, users, tables, and orders.
- [x] Plan for **offline mode** (handling authentication and data syncing).
- [x] Research **Express vs. Spring Boot** compatibility (interchangeability, coexistence).
- [x] Ensure the database supports **multiple restaurants** within the same system.
- [x] Set up **QR code generation service** for table assignments.
- [x] Research **automatic login security risks**.

## Frontend (Vue.js & UI/UX)
- [x] Structure **frontend components** for easy management.
- [x] Implement **basic login and role-based access**.
- [x] Build **basic UI for table management** (adding/joining/splitting tables).
- [x] Ensure the **Back button** is the most accessible and quickest action.
- [x] Check how **page reloading behaves** when mobile screens are locked/unlocked.

## Design (UI/UX Considerations)
- [x] Plan the **Illustrator-like table layout system**.
- [x] Start defining **color schemes and UI customization options** for speed and efficiency.
- [x] Consider dividing table orders into **separate rounds** for better tracking.
- [x] Plan **preset layouts** for different restaurant types.

## Sprint 1 Deliverables:
✔️ **Backend:** Working authentication, role-based access, database models.  
✔️ **Frontend:** Structured Vue app with basic UI and login.  
✔️ **Design:** Initial UI layout for table management.  
✔️ **Setup:** Real-time update research, QR code generation, security planning.
