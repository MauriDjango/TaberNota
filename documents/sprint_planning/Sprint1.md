    - Implement password hashing and security best practices.
    - Support role-based access control (admin, waiter, manager, etc.).
- [ ] **Develop session management and token authentication:** (Estimated hours: 10)
    - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
    - Ensure token expiration and refresh logic.
- [ ] **Create an API for user account management:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Develop endpoints for updating user profiles, changing passwords, and managing roles.
- [ ] **Implement logging and error handling:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Set up centralized logging for API requests and authentication events.
    - Handle common authentication errors gracefully.

## Frontend (Vue.js & UI/UX)
- [ ] **Set up Vue.js frontend project:** (Estimated hours: 6)
    - Configure the project structure and dependencies.
    - Establish communication with the backend.
- [ ] **Develop login and registration UI:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Create a user-friendly authentication form.
    - Implement validation for secure password entry.
- [ ] **Implement session persistence:** (Estimated hours: 6)
    - Ensure users stay logged in across sessions using local storage or cookies.
- [ ] **Create an admin dashboard for user management:** (Estimated hours: 10)
    - Enable admins to add, remove, and update users.
    - Display user roles and statuses in an intuitive interface.
- [ ] **Ensure responsive and accessible UI:** (Estimated hours: 7)
    - Adapt forms for mobile and desktop views.
    - Implement accessibility improvements (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).

## Design (UI/UX Considerations)
- [ ] **Optimize authentication flow for usability:** (Estimated hours: 5)
    - Ensure a seamless experience for logging in and registering.
    - Provide clear error messages for incorrect credentials.
- [ ] **Create a clean and intuitive admin dashboard layout:** (Estimated hours: 6)
    - Design an easy-to-navigate interface for managing users.
    - Use color-coded indicators for different roles and statuses.
- [ ] **Ensure password security best practices:** (Estimated hours: 5)
    - Require strong passwords and provide real-time strength feedback.
    - Offer multi-factor authentication (if feasible).

## Setup & Testing
- [ ] **Test authentication system security:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Verify login, logout, and session expiration behavior.
    - Test for common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, brute force attacks).
- [ ] **Validate API performance and response times:** (Estimated hours: 6)
    - Ensure authentication requests are processed efficiently.
- [ ] **Conduct user management tests:** (Estimated hours: 7)
    - Verify correct role assignment and permissions.
- [ ] **Perform usability testing on login and registration UI:** (Estimated hours: 6)
    - Gather feedback on ease of use and adjust as needed.
