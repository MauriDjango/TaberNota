# Sprint 4 - Worker Tracking & Inventory System

## Backend (Spring Boot & Database)
- [ ] **Implement login time tracking for workers:**
    - Develop an API to record worker login and logout times.
    - Create a model for time entries (e.g., worker ID, login time, logout time, total hours).
    - Implement tracking for overtime or break periods if necessary.
- [ ] **Develop an inventory management system:**
    - Create models for inventory items (e.g., name, quantity, category, reorder level).
    - Implement endpoints for adding, updating, and removing inventory items.
    - Develop a system for stock alerts when items reach reorder levels.
- [ ] **Analytics data collection:**
    - Collect data on worker hours, inventory levels, and other key metrics for the dashboard.

## Frontend (Vue.js & UI/UX)
- [ ] **Worker time tracking UI:**
    - Implement UI components for workers to log in and out.
    - Display current logged-in status and total hours worked for the current shift.
- [ ] **Inventory management UI:**
    - Create an interface for managers to view and update inventory items.
    - Display stock levels and reorder alerts.
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard UI:**
    - Design a dashboard for managers with real-time statistics (e.g., worker hours, inventory status).
    - Implement charts and tables to display data in a clear and understandable format.
    - Include filters for viewing data by time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).

## Design (UI/UX Considerations)
- [ ] **Dashboard usability:**
    - Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate for managers.
    - Focus on clear visualization of statistics (e.g., color-coded alerts for inventory, easy-to-read time logs).
- [ ] **Responsive design for dashboard and management tools:**
    - Ensure that the dashboard and inventory management tools are responsive across devices.

## Setup & Testing
- [ ] **Test time tracking feature:**
    - Ensure accurate logging of worker login and logout times.
    - Test the functionality for overtime and break periods.
- [ ] **Test inventory management system:**
    - Verify the functionality for adding, updating, and removing items.
    - Check if stock alerts trigger correctly when items reach reorder levels.
- [ ] **Test analytics dashboard:**
    - Ensure real-time data is correctly displayed on the dashboard.
    - Validate the accuracy of worker hours and inventory data.
    - Test the responsiveness and performance of the dashboard.
