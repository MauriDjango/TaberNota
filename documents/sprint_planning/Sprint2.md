    - Display real-time status updates (occupied, available, reserved).
- [ ] **Develop order-taking interface:** (Estimated hours: 10)
    - Enable waiters to select menu items and customize orders.
    - Ensure an intuitive and efficient workflow for quick order processing.
- [ ] **Create an interactive menu UI:** (Estimated hours: 8)

    - Allow filtering and searching for quick access.
- [ ] **Implement real-time table status updates:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Ensure table status changes reflect instantly across all user sessions.
- [ ] **Design an order modification UI:** (Estimated hours: 7)
    - Allow staff to modify orders before final submission.
    - Provide clear visibility on changes and order history.

## Design (UI/UX Considerations)
- [ ] **Ensure fast and easy order placement workflow:** (Estimated hours: 5)
    - Minimize unnecessary steps in the ordering process.
    - Optimize UI for touchscreen devices commonly used in restaurants.

    - Provide immediate feedback for changes in order status or table availability.
    - Use non-intrusive alerts for better usability.

## Setup & Testing
- [ ] **Test table assignment and real-time updates:** (Estimated hours: 7)
    - Ensure table availability updates correctly.
    - Verify multiple devices receive consistent real-time updates.
- [ ] **Verify order-taking workflow efficiency:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Test for minimal friction in adding and modifying orders.
- [ ] **Ensure data integrity in order modifications:** (Estimated hours: 7)
    - Prevent inconsistencies when changes occur in ongoing orders.
- [ ] **Test API performance under load:** (Estimated hours: 8)
    - Simulate high traffic to evaluate order and table assignment responsiveness.
- [ ] **Conduct usability testing for table and order management UI:** (Estimated hours: 7)
