# Sprint 5 - Testing, Deployment & Final Adjustments

## Backend (Spring Boot & Database)
- [ ] **Conduct unit tests for backend components:**
    - Write unit tests for key backend functionality (e.g., time tracking, inventory management, payment processing).
    - Test edge cases and error handling for APIs.
- [ ] **Conduct integration tests for backend:**
    - Test integration between different backend services (e.g., payment flow, worker tracking, inventory updates).
    - Verify correct data flow between the backend and database.
- [ ] **Optimize backend performance:**
    - Identify and optimize any bottlenecks in backend performance (e.g., database queries, API response times).
    - Review and improve code efficiency.
- [ ] **Fix final backend bugs:**
    - Address any bugs identified during testing.
    - Ensure all major functionality is working smoothly.

## Frontend (Vue.js & UI/UX)
- [ ] **Conduct unit tests for frontend components:**
    - Write unit tests for core frontend components (e.g., payment interface, worker time tracking UI, dashboard).
    - Test UI elements for proper behavior (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
- [ ] **Conduct integration tests for frontend:**
    - Test integration between frontend components and backend APIs.
    - Ensure data is being correctly displayed and interacted with on the frontend.
- [ ] **Optimize frontend performance:**
    - Review the frontend for any performance issues (e.g., slow page loading, unnecessary re-renders).
    - Implement lazy loading, code splitting, or other techniques to improve performance.
- [ ] **Fix final frontend bugs:**
    - Address any bugs identified during testing.
    - Ensure that all UI components are fully functional and responsive.

## Deployment
- [ ] **Deploy the application to a staging environment:**
    - Set up and configure a staging environment for TaberNota (e.g., AWS, Firebase, etc.).
    - Deploy both frontend and backend to the staging environment.
    - Verify that the deployment works correctly and the application functions as expected.
- [ ] **Verify deployment readiness:**
    - Test the deployed application on the staging environment for any issues before production.
    - Check if all features are properly integrated and functional in the staging environment.

## Documentation
- [ ] **Document backend functionality for future maintenance:**
    - Write documentation for key backend systems (e.g., APIs, payment flow, inventory management).
    - Provide instructions on how to set up and maintain the backend environment.
- [ ] **Document frontend components for future maintenance:**
    - Write documentation for core frontend components (e.g., UI components, state management, routing).
    - Provide instructions on how to set up and maintain the frontend environment.
- [ ] **Write general application documentation:**
    - Create a summary of the application's features and architecture.
    - Provide guidelines for future developers and maintenance.

## Setup & Testing
- [ ] **Conduct end-to-end testing of the application:**
    - Perform end-to-end tests to ensure the entire application works as intended (from login to payment and inventory management).
    - Test user workflows to confirm everything functions seamlessly.
- [ ] **Test performance under load:**
    - Simulate traffic to test how the application performs under heavy load.
    - Optimize areas that show performance issues.

## Sprint 5 Deliverables:
✔️ **Backend:** Unit and integration tests, performance optimizations, bug fixes.  
✔️ **Frontend:** Unit and integration tests, performance optimizations, bug fixes.  
✔️ **Deployment:** Deployed application to staging environment, verified functionality.  
✔️ **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for both backend and frontend systems, general app overview.
