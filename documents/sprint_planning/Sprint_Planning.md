# Sprint Planning Approach

Since this is a multi-faceted application with both worker-side and client-side functionalities, we should break 
development into focused sprints based on feature sets. Given the projectâ€™s scope, I recommend:

Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

    Set up the repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
    Configure the development environment (Vue.js + Vite for frontend, Spring Boot for backend).
    Establish CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).
    Define API structure and basic database schema (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
    Implement authentication (JWT/OAuth for workers and clients).

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables:

    A working skeleton of the application with authentication.
    Backend API with a basic database connection.
    Frontend app with routing and basic layout.

Sprint 2: Worker UI & Ordering System

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

    Design and develop the worker dashboard (Vue components).
    Implement order management (create, update, cancel).
    Define API endpoints for order interactions.
    Implement WebSocket communication for real-time updates.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables:

    A functioning ordering system for workers.
    Real-time order status updates between workers and the kitchen.

Sprint 3: Payment System & Client UI

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

    Implement payment processing via Stripe/PayPal.
    Develop the client-side UI for bill viewing and payments.
    Implement QR-based table association.
    Enable bill splitting via client-side interactions.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables:

    A fully functional payment system.
    A client UI for bill payments.

Sprint 4: Worker Tracking & Inventory System

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

    Implement login time tracking for workers.
    Develop an inventory management system.
    Create a dashboard for managers with real-time statistics.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables:

    Time tracking feature for workers.
    Inventory tracking with stock alerts.
    A working analytics dashboard.

Sprint 5: Testing, Deployment & Final Adjustments

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

    Conduct unit and integration tests for backend and frontend.
    Deploy the application to a staging environment.
    Optimize performance and fix final bugs.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables:

    A deployed and tested version of TaberNota.
    Documentation for future maintenance.
