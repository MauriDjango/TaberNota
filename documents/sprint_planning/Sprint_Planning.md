# Sprint Planning Approach

Since this is a multi-faceted application with both worker-side and client-side functionalities, development will be broken into focused sprints based on feature sets. Each sprint will have clear objectives and deliverables, ensuring a structured and iterative development process.

## Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

ðŸ”¹ **Objectives:**
- Set up the repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Configure the development environment (Vue.js + Vite for frontend, Spring Boot for backend).
- Establish CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD).
- Define the API structure and basic database schema (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- Implement authentication (JWT/OAuth for workers and clients).
- Develop basic UI components for authentication and navigation.

ðŸ”¹ **Deliverables:**
- A working skeleton of the application with authentication.
- Backend API with a basic database connection and authentication endpoints.
- Frontend app with routing, authentication pages, and a basic layout.
- Functional CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Sprint 2: Worker UI & Ordering System

ðŸ”¹ **Objectives:**
- Design and develop the worker dashboard (Vue components).
- Implement order management (create, update, cancel).
- Define API endpoints for order interactions.
- Implement WebSocket communication for real-time updates.
- Ensure role-based access for workers (e.g., waiters, kitchen staff, managers).

ðŸ”¹ **Deliverables:**
- A functioning worker dashboard for order management.
- API endpoints for real-time order updates.
- WebSocket-based real-time communication between workers and the kitchen.
- Role-based access control for different worker types.
