# Sprint 3 - Security, Payments, and Advanced Customization

## Backend (Spring Boot & Database)
- [ ] Implement **password recovery system**, ensuring security measures go through the manager role.
- [ ] Develop **worker authentication system** (session management, permissions enforcement).
- [ ] Improve **security measures** for automatic login (evaluate risks and mitigation strategies).
- [ ] Implement **table access control**, ensuring only authorized users can open a table.
- [ ] Enhance **database structure** to support customizations and additional restaurant types.
- [ ] Research and implement **secure payment handling** (Google Pay, card scanning).
- [ ] Develop **audit logs** for tracking financial transactions and user actions.

## Frontend (Vue.js & UI/UX)
- [ ] Implement **password recovery UI** with secure authentication steps.
- [ ] Ensure **role-based access control (RBAC)** is enforced in the frontend.
