## Application Overview

The goal of TaberNota is to improve outdated and user-unfriendly restaurant terminal systems by offering a more 
intuitive and efficient solution. Current systems in the market often create bottlenecks in workflows, leading to 
delays in order processing and payment management. TaberNota solves these issues with a user-friendly interface, 
client-side payment functionalities, and a backend system that ensures real-time updates and smooth operations. This 
project also supports offline functionality and cloud data syncing for improved reliability.

## Objective Audience

This application is primarily aimed at the restaurant and bar industry, with a focus on businesses in the Community of 
Andaluc√≠a, Spain. TaberNota seeks to provide a competitive edge in the crowded restaurant industry by reducing 
operational inefficiencies, speeding up service times, and allowing clients to take a more active role in managing 
their orders and payments.

## Market Analysis

Existing restaurant terminal systems are often difficult to navigate and lack modern features such as client-side 
payment and analytics. TaberNota differentiates itself by offering a streamlined, easy-to-use interface, client-side 
payment options (including bill splitting), and robust analytics for improving business performance.
